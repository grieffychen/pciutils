       * memory handles and manually calls __dpmi_map_device_in_memory_block()
       * or __dpmi_map_conventional_memory_in_memory_block() per every handle.
       *
       * We can easily access only linear addresses in our DS segment which
       * is managed by DJGPP sbrk allocator. So allocate page-aligned range
       * by aligned_alloc() (our wrapper around malloc()/memalign()) and then
       * for every subrange which is backed by different DPMI memory handle
       * call appropriate mapping function which correctly calculated offset
       * and length to have continuous representation of physical memory range.
       *
       * This approach has disadvantage that for each mapping it is required
       * to reserve and allocate committed memory in RAM with the size of the
       * mapping itself. This has negative impact for mappings of large sizes.

       * extended for this functionality, the corresponding DPMI function
       * __dpmi_allocate_linear_memory() is DPMI 1.0 function and not widely
